Sales &amp; Inventory analysis of a chain of Mexican toy stores

Sales and Inventory data is collected from a chain of toy stores in Mexico. It includes data regarding products, stores, current inventory levels at each store location and daily sales. 

The data along with the data dictionary is available for perusal as well, the data folder. 

The project starts off with the creation of two smaller tables: Products and Stores. The larger tables - sales and inventory - were imported into SQL Server, from their respective csv files.  

After an initial exploration of the data, including the type of variables, the number of rows/columns and the number of distinct categories of products/stores, several metrics - including average product cost, total sales, etc. - were determined. Details about store location and the trajectory of store openings were also uncovered. 

The following questions were then answered:

1) Are there any seasonal trends or patterns in the data?
2) Which products and stores drive the best sales?
3) What happens when products are out-of-stock? How much monetary value is lost? 

A data cleanup was performed at the end. 

There are 3 SQL Server files that were created during the course of this project.
